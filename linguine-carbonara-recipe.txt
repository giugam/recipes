Linguine alla carbonara

Ingredients:
------------
Serves: 4

350g linguine
200g guanciale (pancetta) or bacon
2 whole eggs and 1 yolk
80g grated Parmigiano or Pecorino Romano cheese
olive oil
salt
pepper

Method:
-------
Prep: 5 min    
Cook: 7 min   
Ready in: 12 min

Bring to the boil a large pan of water (at least 4 litre), adding two full dessert spoons of coarse salt when water starts to boil.
Throw in the pasta (do not break the linguine) after the water is boiling again.
Gently push the linguine into the water as they soften and sinking into the boiling water. Stir them from time to time. 
A few minutes before the linguine are ready (see packet of pasta for cooking time) shallow fry in a non stick pan the diced pancetta for only a couple minutes.
The pasta needs to be just short of "al dente" when you drain it as it will continue cooking in the pan. Drain the pasta and throw it in the pan together with the pancetta and continue to fry it.
Off the heat prepare a large serving bowl and lightly whisk two full eggs and one yolk with a pinch of salt and the grated cheese.
Throw the pasta sauteed with the pancetta on top of it and give it a quick mix before serving (in case sprinkle some olive oil when mixing).
Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper.

Buon Appetito!
